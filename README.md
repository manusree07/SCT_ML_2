# SCT_ML_2
# Customer Segmentation using K-Means Clustering

## Overview
This project implements a **K-Means Clustering algorithm** to segment **retail store customers** based on their purchase behavior, using features like **Annual Income** and **Spending Score**. It is part of **Task 2** of the **SkillCraft Technology Internship**.

The project demonstrates a complete **unsupervised machine learning workflow**, from data preprocessing to evaluation and visualization.

## Features
- Data preprocessing and feature selection  
- Feature scaling using **StandardScaler**  
- Determination of optimal number of clusters using:  
  - **Elbow Method (Inertia)**  
  - **Silhouette Score**  
- K-Means clustering and assigning cluster labels  
- Visualization of customer segments and cluster centers  
- Profiling each cluster to derive actionable insights  

## Technologies Used
- Python  
- Pandas, NumPy  
- Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- scikit-learn  

## Usage
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>
